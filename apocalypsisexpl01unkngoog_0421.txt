[ CAPUT TERTIUM. VERS: 2ο. 417

„soever ye shall perceive yourselves to have offended, either
l „by will, word or deed, there to bewail your own sinfulness,
„and to confess yourselves to Almighty God, with full pur-
f „pose of amendment of life. And if ye shall perceive your
) „offences to be such as are not only against God, but also
„against your neighbour3‚ then γε, shall reconcile yourselves
„unto them, being ready to make restitution and satisfaction
μ „according to the uttermost of your power, for all injuries
l „and wrongs done by you to any other3 and being likewise
ί „ready to forgive others that have offended you, as ye would
1 „have forgiveness of your offences at God's hand: for other-
¹ „wise the receiving of the holy communion doth nothing else
„but encrease your damnation. Therefore if any of you be a
„blasphemer of God, an hinderer, or slanderer of His Word,
„an adulterer, or be in malice or envy, or in any other grie-
„vous crime, repent you of your sins, or else come not to
„that holy Table3 lest after the taking of that holy Sacrament
„the devil enter into you , as he entered into JudaS, and fill
„you full of iniquitie8‚ and bring yon to destruction both of
„body and soul. -- Judge therefore yourselv'e5‚ that ye be
„not judgcd of the Lord 3 repent you truly for your sins past3
‚, have 3 lively and stedfast saith in Christ our Saviour3 amend
„your lives ‚ and be in perfect charity with all men. —-- Ye
„that do truly and earnestly repent you of your sine, and are
„in love and charity with your neighbours , and intend to
„live agnew life following the commendements of efod, and
„walking from hencefqrth in His holy ways3 draw near with
„faith, and take this holy Sacrament to your comfort, and
„make your humble confession to Almighty God.“ —— Ex
his nunc videri potest, quod Doctores et Antistites Eccle-
siae sciant et non sciant, quod haec via sit via ad Coelum,
et non via fidei absque illa3 sciunt cum illa quae allata sunt
eoram populo orant et praedicant, sed non sciunt cum ex
doctrina sua docent3 villam viam vocant Religionem practicam,
hane autem Religionem Christianam 3 sed hanc credunt esse
pro sapientibus, illam autem pro simplicibus: verum asse· [276]
verare possum, quod qui vivunt secundum Doctrinam de sola„

fide et de justificatione per illam, prorsus nullam fidem spiri-
